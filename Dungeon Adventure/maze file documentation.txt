...triggers are the exact same at the moment, I will probably have to change them but I'm not exactly sure what parts I will change





I decided to let the user define the monsters and items. I will of course make my own file(s) for the game for
a user to play, but this way, anyone can make their own game with their own monsters and items and rooms.

For both monsters and items, the images are dependent on the name of the monster/item.
For monsters, if we have 3 animation frames, it'll be like: kobold_1.png, kobold_2.png, kobold_3.png
For items, the image should be static, so it'll just be like: horseshoe.png
