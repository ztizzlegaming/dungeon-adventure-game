# Dungeon Adventure Game

### What is this
This is a first person dungeon adventure game, written in Java, for my final project for CSC 300 (Software Development) with Prof. Toth.

### How do setup the program?
The easiest way to setup and run the program is to clone this repository and import it into Eclipse, and run the Runner class from there. You can also run it from the command line, if you want.

### How do you play?
To play the game, you use WSAD to move, Q and E to rotate, and the mouse to pick up/drop/use items. You can also use the move/turn buttons on the screen. To pick up items, click on them in the room. To use an item, left click on it in your inventory. Using a weapon or armor sets this as your active weapon or armor, which is shown under the inventory. Using a health item restores that amount of health, then discards the item. Monsters and combat are soon on the way.

But Kate thinks it's hard to play. :( 

You have to go to different rooms and collect different things. 

You have lives, and if you're running low on lives/energy, you'll need to go collect some magic potion! 

:D Enjoy!
