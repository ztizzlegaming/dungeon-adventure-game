# Dungeon Adventure Game

### What is this
This is a first person dungeon adventure game, written in Java, for my final project for CSC 300 (Software Development) with Prof. Toth.

### How do setup the program?
If you are only interested in playing the game, just download the game.jar file and you are good to go. To get the project into Eclipse, clone this repository and import it into Eclipse, and run the Runner class from there. You can also run it from the command line, if you want.

### How do you play?
* To move, use W, S, A, D, and Q and E to turn, or just click the buttons.
* To pick up an item, click on it in the room.
* To drop an item, right click on it in your inventory.
* To view the information about an item in your inventory, middle mouse click on it (the information is printed to the console).
* To attack a monster, just click on it on the screen. There is a boss fight at the very end of the maze.
* If you die and want to play again, just restart the game.
* To view the command line output (if you want to be able to see the item stats when you middle mouse click on them, you have to run the game from the command like, like: “java -jar game.jar”.

There is music, both for calm and action (when you are fighting a monster). The calm music is Starboy by The Weeknd and Daft Punk, and the action music is Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I am not claiming that the music is mine.

:D Enjoy!
